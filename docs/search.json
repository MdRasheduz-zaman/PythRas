    "text": "tibble\nOne major aspect of the tidyverse is formatting tables as tibble instead of data.frame. A tibble “is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not.” It is super simple to convert a data.frame into a tibble, but you must have the tidyverse R package {tibble} installed and loaded - which it is if you are loading the entire {tidyverse}. Let us convert our df into a tibble and call it tbl:\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\ntbl &lt;- as_tibble(df)\ntbl\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 2\n   weight group\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;\n 1   4.17 ctrl \n 2   5.58 ctrl \n 3   5.18 ctrl \n 4   6.11 ctrl \n 5   4.5  ctrl \n 6   4.61 ctrl \n 7   5.17 ctrl \n 8   4.53 ctrl \n 9   5.33 ctrl \n10   5.14 ctrl \n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n\nOf course, the data itself does not change - only its format and the way it is displayed to us in R. If you compare the output we get from printing tbl here to that of printing df above, I would like to point out some things I find extremely convenient for tibbles:\n\nThere is an extra first line telling us about the number of rows and columns.\nThere is an extra line below the column names telling us about the data type of each column.\nOnly the first ten rows of data are printed and a “… with 20 more rows” is added below.\nIt can’t be seen here, but this would analogously happen if there were too many columns.\nIt can’t be seen here, but missing values NA and negative numbers are printed in red.\n\nFinally, note that in its heart, a tibble is still a data.frame and in most cases you can do everything with a tibble that you can do with a data.frame:\n\n\n\nclass(tbl)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\nstr(tbl)\n\ntibble [30 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ weight: num [1:30] 4.17 5.58 5.18 6.11 4.5 4.61 5.17 4.53 5.33 5.14 ...\n $ group : Factor w/ 3 levels \"ctrl\",\"trt1\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\nsummary(tbl)\n\n     weight       group   \n Min.   :3.590   ctrl:10  \n 1st Qu.:4.550   trt1:10  \n Median :5.155   trt2:10  \n Mean   :5.073            \n 3rd Qu.:5.530            \n Max.   :6.310            \n\ntbl$weight\n\n [1] 4.17 5.58 5.18 6.11 4.50 4.61 5.17 4.53 5.33 5.14 4.81 4.17 4.41 3.59 5.87\n[16] 3.83 6.03 4.89 4.32 4.69 6.31 5.12 5.54 5.50 5.37 5.29 4.92 6.15 5.80 5.26\n\ntbl$group\n\n [1] ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1\n[16] trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2\nLevels: ctrl trt1 trt2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass(df)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nstr(df)\n\n'data.frame':   30 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ weight: num  4.17 5.58 5.18 6.11 4.5 4.61 5.17 4.53 5.33 5.14 ...\n $ group : Factor w/ 3 levels \"ctrl\",\"trt1\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\nsummary(df)\n\n     weight       group   \n Min.   :3.590   ctrl:10  \n 1st Qu.:4.550   trt1:10  \n Median :5.155   trt2:10  \n Mean   :5.073            \n 3rd Qu.:5.530            \n Max.   :6.310            \n\ndf$weight\n\n [1] 4.17 5.58 5.18 6.11 4.50 4.61 5.17 4.53 5.33 5.14 4.81 4.17 4.41 3.59 5.87\n[16] 3.83 6.03 4.89 4.32 4.69 6.31 5.12 5.54 5.50 5.37 5.29 4.92 6.15 5.80 5.26\n\ndf$group\n\n [1] ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl ctrl trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1\n[16] trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt1 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2 trt2\nLevels: ctrl trt1 trt2\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, I almost always format my datasets as tibbles."

By default, this function takes what came out of the previous pipe and puts it as its first argument. This happens with every pipe. You’ll notice that all the functions who required two arguments above, now only need one argument, i.e. the additional argument, because the main argument stating which data is to be used is by default simply what came out of the previous pipe. Accordingly, the functions sqrt() and sort() appear empty here, because they only need one piece of information and that is which data they should work with.

Get 50 mosquitoes from insectary.\n1. Obtain the necessary number of mosquitoes for the experiment.\n1. Ensure mosquitoes are healthy and of the correct species/strain.\n\n\n2. Make 5 pools each consisting of 10 mosquitoes in 2ml tubes containing steel balls.\n2. Pooling increases sample size and reduces variability.\n2. Avoid cross-contamination between pools.\n\n\n3. Make 3 Medium aliquots containing 2ml medium each.\n3. Medium is used as a negative control.\n3. Prepare medium under sterile conditions.\n\n\n4. Add 10^4/ml particles to one 2ml aliquot -&gt; mix.\n4. Create a spike-in sample with a known concentration of particles.\n4. Verify particle concentration and mix thoroughly.\n\n\n5. Add 10^6/ml particles to the second 2ml aliquot -&gt; mix.\n5. Create a spike-in sample with a higher concentration of particles.\n5. Verify particle concentration and mix thoroughly.\n\n\n6. Add 750µl of the 10^4 solution to two pools each and 250µl of the 10^4 solution to Trizol LS (Sample 1).\n6. Spike-in controls help assess extraction efficiency.\n6. Pipette accurately to ensure proper spike-in concentrations.\n\n\n7. Add 750µl of the 10^6 solution to two pools each and 250µl of the 10^6 solution to Trizol LS (Sample 2).\n7. Spike-in controls help assess extraction efficiency.\n7. Pipette accurately to ensure proper spike-in concentrations.\n\n\n8. Add 750µl of the control medium to the last mosquito pool and 250µl of the medium to Trizol LS (Sample 3).\n8. The control medium sample serves as a baseline for comparison.\n8. Ensure control medium is sterile and particle-free.\n\n\n9. Store Trizol LS samples @ -80°C.\n9. Trizol LS preserves RNA/DNA integrity.\n9. Maintain consistent -80°C storage for all samples.\n\n\n10. Homogenize the pools 2 min @ 30 Hz.\n10. Disrupts mosquito tissues and releases nucleic acids.\n10. Check homogenizer settings and ensure thorough disruption.\n\n\n11. Centrifuge all samples for 3 min @ 20000g.\n11. Separates cellular debris from the supernatant containing nucleic acids.\n11. Use appropriate centrifuge settings and time.\n\n\n12. Take 250µl of the supernatant of the smaller control and pools and add it to Trizol LS -&gt; -80°C (Samples 4-6).\n12. Collects a representative sample for later RNA/DNA extraction.\n12. Avoid disturbing the pellet when collecting supernatant.\n\n\n13. Transfer the remaining supernatant to a fresh tube (for all pools).\n13. Removes debris and potential inhibitors from the supernatant.\n13. Transfer supernatant carefully to avoid contamination.\n\n\n14. Centrifuge for 10 min @ 20000g.\n14. Further clarifies the supernatant.\n14. Check centrifuge settings and time.\n\n\n14_1. Take out the plunger from a filtering syringe, and put the empty cylinder on top of a new tube.\n14_1. Prepare the syringe for filtration.\n14_1. Ensure the filter is compatible with the sample type.\n\n\n14_2. Transfer the sample into the empty cylinder.\n14_2. Begin the filtration process.\n14_2. Avoid spilling or losing sample during transfer.\n\n\n14_3. Hold the cylinder firmly, and insert the plunger. Push it to filter the sample through the filter. Some dead volume will not be passed through.\n14_3. Complete the filtration step.\n14_3. Apply consistent pressure to the plunger for even filtration.\n\n\n15. Transfer supernatant/filtered volume to ultracentrifuge tubes.\n15. Prepare for ultracentrifugation.\n15. Use appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes.\nThese tubes are in the ultrcentrifugation room in the closet.\n\n\n16. Underlay the sample with 20% Sucrose in PBS.\n16. Sucrose cushion helps to concentrate particles during ultracentrifugation.\n16. Prepare sucrose solution accurately.\nFind out the heaviest one and add PBS to other tubes to make the same volume.\nAdd 1.2mL PBS first to the sample and then add the 20% sucrose.\n\n\n17. Pellet particles 1h @ 483 750 g (or higher).\n17. Ultracentrifugation pellets particles.\n17. Use correct ultracentrifuge settings and time.\nWe need 60WS to get 48375g.\n\n\n18. Carefully remove supernatant (best by careful decanting).\n18. Removes unwanted supernatant.\n18. Avoid disturbing the pellet when removing supernatant.\n\n\n19. Leave the tubes bottoms up for a few minutes to drain any fluid.\n19. Ensure all supernatant is removed.\n19. Complete drainage before proceeding to the next step.\n\n\n20. Add 1ml Trizol to the pellets (Samples 7-11) -&gt; store @ -80°C till processing.\n20. Trizol preserves RNA/DNA in the pelleted particles.\n20. Add Trizol directly to the pellet to prevent degradation."

AM9780) to remove RNase contamination from work surfaces and non-disposable items such as centrifuges and pipettes used during purification.\nLyse samples and separate phases\n\nLyse and homogenize samples in TRIzol™ Reagent according to your starting material.\n\n\nTissues:\nAdd 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 50–100 mg of tissue to the sample and homogenize using a homogenizer.\nCell grown in monolayer:\n\n\nRemove growth media.\n\nAdd 0.3–0.4 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 1 × \\(10^{5}—10^{7}\\) cells directly to the culture dish to lyse the cells.\n\nPipet the lysate up and down several times to homogenize.\n\n\nCells grown in suspension:\n\n\n\nPellet the cells by centrifugation and discard the supernatant.\n\nAdd 0.75 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent per 0.25 mL of sample (5–10 × \\(10^{6}\\) cells from animal, plant, or yeasty origin or 1 × \\(10^{7}\\) cells of bacterial origin) to the pellet.Note: Do not wash cells before addition of TRIzol™ Reagent to avoid mRNA degradation.\n\nPipette the lysate up and down several times to homogenize.Note: The sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis.\n\nSTOPPING POINT Samples can be stored at 4°C overnight or at –20°C for up to a year.\n\n\n(Optional) If samples have a high fat content, centrifuge the lysate for 5 minutes at 12,000 g at 4–10°C, then transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\n\n\nMechanistic Details\n\n\nComments for Troubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n3. Incubate for 5 minutes to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoproteins complex.\n3. Incubation allows the denaturing agents in TRIzol to disrupt cellular structures and dissolve membranes.\n3. If complete dissociation doesn't occur, increase incubation time or use a higher concentration of TRIzol.\n\n\n4. Add 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis, then securely cap the tube.\n4. Chloroform further denatures proteins and promotes phase separation.\n4. Ensure proper mixing of chloroform and TRIzol. Vortex briefly after adding chloroform.\n\n\n5. Incubate for 2–3 minutes.\n5. This step enhances phase separation and ensures thorough mixing.\n5. Check sample temperature to ensure it's close to room temperature.\n\n\n6. Centrifuge the sample for 15 minutes at 12,000 × g at 4°C. The mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform, and interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase.\n6. Centrifugation causes the sample to separate into distinct layers based on density.\n6. Ensure correct centrifuge speed and time. Incomplete separation may indicate issues with centrifugation.\n\n\n7. Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipette the solution out.\n7. The aqueous phase contains RNA, while DNA and proteins are in the interphase and organic phase, respectively.\n7. Use a micropipette with a wide-bore tip to avoid shearing RNA. Be careful not to disturb the interphase.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT! Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette when removing the aqueous phase. \nProceed directly to “Isolate RNA” on page 2.\nSave the interphase and organic phase if you want to isolate DNA or protein. See “Isolate DNA” on page 3 or “Isolate proteins” on page 4 for detailed procedures. The organic phase can be stored at 4°C overnight."

    "text": "Troubleshooting: RT-qPCR\n\nI will make a shiny app for the calculation online for any number of #sample.\n\nN.B. For the NTC, we need everything except the RNA sample (use RNase-free water instead of sample).\n\nUsing WNV-Ag-ID-Path.prcl One-Step RT-PCR protocol.\n\n\n\n\nRT-qPCR Run Info\n\n\n\nThere are 6 steps in the RT-qPCR. Here goes the mechanistic details of the steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps\nMechanism\n\n\n\nStep 1: Reverse Transcription (RT)\nThe reverse transcriptase enzyme is active at this temperature, converting the RNA template into complementary DNA (cDNA). This is a crucial step as qPCR amplifies DNA, not RNA.\n\n\nStep 2: Initial Denaturation and Enzyme Activation\nThe high temperature serves two purposes:\nDenaturation: Separates double-stranded RNA/DNA into single strands, making them accessible for primers.\nHot-start activation: Activates the hot-start Taq polymerase, which prevents non-specific amplification at lower temperatures.\n\n\nStep 3: Denaturation\nRepeated in each cycle, this step ensures complete separation of newly synthesized DNA strands, allowing primers to bind in the next step.\n\n\nStep 4: Annealing\nThe primers, designed to be complementary to specific regions of the target DNA, bind (anneal) to their respective targets. Lowering the temperature facilitates this binding.\n\n\nStep 5: Extension\nThe Taq polymerase extends the primers, synthesizing new complementary DNA strands. This results in the doubling of the target DNA in each cycle.\n\n\nStep 6: Data Acquisition and Analysis\nThe duration varies (usually a brief step at a temperature between annealing and extension)\nFAM Fluorescence: The machine measures the fluorescence of the FAM dye, which is typically incorporated into the amplifying DNA (either through a probe or intercalating dye like SYBR Green). The FAM signal increases proportionally with the amount of target DNA.\nROX Fluorescence: The ROX dye acts as a passive reference. Its fluorescence should remain constant throughout the run. The machine uses the ROX signal to normalize the FAM signal, correcting for well-to-well variations and potential errors in pipetting.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Stuffs\n\nReagents are in -20°C fridge (opposite of -80°C fridge).\n\nTurn on all the switches on the sample hood and rotate the key to turn on. Take the slash up (folded).\n\nLook if the scissor is there to cut your plate and sealing accordingly.\n\nPrint out the design and keep there to organize the Master Mix (MM) and samples accordingly. Use FAM and ROX for this experiment.\n\nKeep the enzyme mix always on the cooling block till use.\n\nTake gloves.\n\nThe cooling blocks change color depending on how hot they are.\n\nTake 10µL, 20µL, 100µL, 200µL tip boxes if needed. Pipettes are there already inside the hoods.\n\nSamples on ice.\n\nTake 1 black box and take ice in it (from downstairs, left hand side while entering). Put the ice boxes in it.\n\nTake another black box with plate & sealing (touch only with gloves).\n\nTake 2 Eppendorf tube holders, one for sample and one for H2O, Buffer.\n\nTouch the RNA sample and reagents only with gloves.\n\nKeep FAM and Enzyme inside the black box, because it is color sensitive.\n\nTake the small white box to keep the well plate (with sealing) on the ice box inside it to remove potential contamination issue. Take out when needed after making the MM.\n\nClean the MM hood and Sample hood with alcohol first and then start working/putting things inside.\n\nThe centrifuge machine for well plate works this way: Turn on –&gt; Place the plate –&gt; Run for 10-20 secs –&gt; Take out –&gt; Turn off\n\nUse the first point to pipette off the 11.5 µL MM, don’t push too much. A bit will remain in the tip. That’s fine. It will be the same for all the wells.

Otherwise, you might take something from the well and make aerosol (contaminant).\n\n\nSample handling: Don’t press hard (second point), pipette multiple times and take carefully. Then put in the well carefully.

Start with clean, non-polyadenylated RNA of interest. The sample should be EDTA-free, with no salts present.\nEnsures that the RNA sample is free of contaminants that could interfere with the polyadenylation reaction.\nIf the RNA sample contains EDTA or salts, perform a cleanup step using ethanol precipitation or a commercial RNA purification kit.\n\n\n2. In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, set up 3’ polyadenylation reaction as follows:\n* Non-polyadenylated RNA X μl ≤ 10 μg\n* 10X E. coli poly(A) polymerase buffer 2 μl 1X\n* ATP (10 mM) 2 μl 1 mM\n* Nuclease-free water 15-X μl\n* E. coli poly(A) polymerase (5 U/μl) 1 μl 5U\n* TOTAL 20 μl\nCombines the RNA template with the necessary reagents for polyadenylation, including the enzyme, buffer, ATP (the source of adenosine nucleotides), and nuclease-free water to adjust the final volume.\nEnsure accurate pipetting, especially with small volumes. Use high-quality, RNase-free reagents.\n\n\n3. Incubate at 37°C for 0.5–1.5 minutes.\nProvides the optimal temperature for the E. coli poly(A) polymerase enzyme to add adenosine nucleotides to the 3' end of the RNA molecules.\nEnsure accurate temperature control and timing during incubation. Longer incubation times will result in longer poly(A) tails, but may decrease overall sequencing yield.\n\n\n4. After 0.5–1.5 minutes of incubation, stop the reaction by adding 5 μl of 50 mM EDTA (to a final concentration of 10 mM EDTA). Final volume will be 25 μl.\nEDTA chelates divalent cations (like Mg2+), which are essential for the polymerase enzyme's activity, effectively stopping the reaction.\nEnsure thorough mixing after adding EDTA to stop the reaction completely.\n\n\n5. Add 45 μl of RNase-free SPRI beads to the reaction.\nAMPure XP beads selectively bind to RNA, allowing for purification and removal of contaminants like enzymes, salts, and unincorporated nucleotides.\nEnsure beads are well-mixed and at room temperature. Use the correct bead-to-sample ratio.\n\n\n6. Incubate on a Hula Mixer for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nMixing promotes efficient binding of RNA to the beads.\nUse a thermomixer or rotator for consistent mixing.\n\n\n7. Spin down the sample and pellet on a magnet. Keep the tube on the magnet and pipette off and discard the supernatant.\nMagnetic separation facilitates removal of unwanted components in the supernatant.\nUse a strong magnet and avoid disturbing the beads.\n\n\n8. Keep the tube on the magnet and wash the beads with 200 μl of freshly-prepared 70% ethanol. Carefully turn the tube 180° twice in the rack to wash pelleted beads. Pippette off and discard the supernatant.\nEthanol washes remove residual contaminants and salts from the beads.\nUse fresh 70% ethanol. Carefully turn the tube to ensure all beads are washed.\n\n\n9. Repeat the previous step for a total of two washes.\nSecond wash further improves purity.\nRepeat washing if the supernatant is still cloudy.\n\n\n10. Briefly spin down and place the tube back on the magnet. Pipette off any residual ethanol. Allow to dry for 30 seconds, but do not dry the pellet to the point of cracking.\nRemoves any remaining ethanol, which can interfere with downstream steps.\nAvoid over-drying the beads, which can make elution difficult.\n\n\n11. Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the pellet in 12 μl of nuclease-free water. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.\nElution buffer releases the purified RNA from the beads. Incubation on ice helps maintain RNA integrity.\nUse nuclease-free water for elution. Ensure complete resuspension of the beads.\n\n\n12. Pellet the beads on a magnet until the eluate is clear and colourless.\nMagnetic separation collects the beads, leaving the purified RNA in the supernatant.\nUse a strong magnet and allow sufficient time for clear eluate.\n\n\n13. Remove and retain 12 μl of eluate containing the 3’-polyadenylated RNA in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nCollects the purified, polyadenylated RNA for further analysis or downstream applications.\nAvoid transferring any beads with the eluate.\n\n\n14. Remove 1 μl of final eluate and quantify the final concentration using HS RNA Qubit kit.\nMeasures the concentration of the purified, polyadenylated RNA to assess yield and quality.\nEnsure accurate calibration of the Qubit fluorometer. If yield is low, troubleshoot previous steps.\n\n\nOptional step: Dilute the final eluate to 100 ng/μl and quantify 1 μl using Agilent 6000 Nano RNA kit, using total RNA or mRNA setting depending on the sample.\nProvides additional information about RNA size distribution and integrity.\nEnsure proper chip preparation and instrument calibration for the Agilent Bioanalyzer.\n\n\n15. Store the final product at -80°C.\nLong-term storage preserves the RNA for future use.\nMaintain consistent -80°C storage to prevent RNA degradation.\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse Transcription and Strand-switching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\n\n\nMechanistic Details\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n\n1. Prepare the following reaction in a 0.2 ml PCR tube:\nx μl poly A+ RNA, 100 ng\n2.5 μl VNP\n1 μl 10 mM dNTPs\n7.5-x μl RNase-free water\nCombines mRNA template, VNP (a template switching oligo), dNTPs, and water. VNP anneals to the polyA tail of mRNA and provides a template for reverse transcription.\nEnsure accurate quantification and integrity of RNA. Use high-quality, RNase-free water.\n\n\n2. Mix gently by flicking the tube, and spin down\nEnsures all components are well mixed and collects any condensation on the tube walls.\nAvoid vigorous mixing, which can shear RNA.\n\n\n3. Incubate at 65°C for 5 minutes and then snap cool on a pre-chilled freezer block for 1 minute\nHigh temperature denatures RNA secondary structures. Snap cooling prevents re-formation of secondary structures and promotes annealing of VNP to the polyA tail.\nUse a pre-chilled freezer block for efficient snap cooling.\n\n\n4. In a separate tube, mix together the following:\n4 μl 5x RT Buffer\n1 μl RNaseOUT\n1 μl Nuclease-free water\n2 μl Strand-Switching Primer (SSP)\nPrepares the reverse transcription and strand-switching buffer containing the necessary reagents.\nPrepare the buffer fresh and keep it on ice.

Resuspend in 30 μl EB by pipetting\nElution buffer releases the purified DNA from the beads.\nUse the correct volume of elution buffer. Ensure complete resuspension of the beads.\n\n\n14. Incubate off the magnetic rack for 2 min\nIncubation allows the DNA to fully rehydrate and elute from the beads.\nIncubate at the correct temperature and time.\n\n\n15. Replace on magnetic rack\nMagnetic separation collects the beads, leaving the purified DNA in the supernatant.\nUse a strong magnet and allow sufficient time for clear eluate.\n\n\n16. Transfer eluted DNA to a fresh 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube\nCollects the purified, barcoded DNA for further processing.\nAvoid transferring any beads with the eluate.\n\n\n17. Label tube accordingly with an ethanol-resistant labmarker\nEnsures proper identification of the sample.\nUse a marker that won't smudge or fade when exposed to ethanol."
