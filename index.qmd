PythRas starts out as a step-by-step introduction to R, Python, Linux and Command-line Tools, Probability and Statistics, etc. while its later parts are more of a cookbook with analyses of typical examples in life sciences with focus on (Molecular) Biology, Breeding and Genetics, (Gen)-omics, Medical Science, Agriculture, Ecology and other related fields.
