## Linux and WSL(2)

Try to use Linux to do better in life. The black screen of Linux is way more powerful than you (probably) know till now. Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) to install Ubuntu (a Linux distribution).

Follow this pages to install `Windows Subsystem for Linux` if you are using Windows. Then you can use the WSL just like a native Linux using your system. You can't do anything except using Linux to analyse Genomic (sequencing) data. So, **better start now**.

Follow [link1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) & [link2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to get step-by-step guideline to do it.

The problem here is, I am not using Windows. So, I might not be able to help you if there is any issue you are facing while installing WSL2. But I can try. A tip will be **update your kernel first and then try**.

## Intro

```{bash}
# Your Linux/Bash code here 
echo "Hello from Bash!" 
ls -l
```
